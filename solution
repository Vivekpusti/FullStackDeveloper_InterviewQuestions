 Section 1: Java Spring Boot

1.
Spring Boot is a framework that is built on top of the Spring framework and is used for building web applications in Java.
It is designed to make the development of web applications faster and easier by providing a set of tools and conventions 
that help developers get up and running quickly. Spring Boot is different from other Spring frameworks in that it provides
a pre-configured environment that eliminates the need for developers to manually configure the application.

2.
Spring Data JPA is a library that provides a simple and easy way to interact with relational databases using the Java
Persistence API (JPA). In Spring Boot applications, Spring Data JPA is used to handle database operations by providing
pre-built repository classes that can be used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

3.
Dependency Injection is a design pattern used in Spring Boot that enables developers to write loosely coupled code.
It allows the framework to handle the creation and management of objects and their dependencies, rather than the developer
having to do it manually. In Spring Boot, dependency injection is achieved through the use of Inversion of Control (IoC) 
containers, such as the Spring container.

4. 
Spring Security is a framework that is used to provide security to Spring Boot applications. It is designed to handle 
authentication and authorization, including support for various authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth, LDAP, and HTTP
Basic Authentication. Spring Security provides a set of pre-built filters and handlers that can be used to secure various 
parts of the application.

5.
In Spring, a Bean is simply an object that is managed by the Spring container. Beans are created using a set of rules 
and conventions that are defined in the Spring configuration files. In Spring Boot applications, Beans are created automatically
based on the annotations used in the code, such as @Component, @Service, and @Controller.

 Section 2: Flutter

6.
Flutter is a mobile development framework that is used to build high-performance, cross-platform applications for Android, iOS,
and the web. It is built on top of the Dart programming language and provides a set of pre-built widgets and tools that make it 
easy to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces. Flutter's advantages over other mobile development frameworks include its
fast development cycle, hot reload feature, and its ability to create a single codebase for multiple platforms.

7.
Stateless Widgets are widgets that do not have any mutable state. They are used to represent parts of the user interface that do 
not change, such as text or images. Stateful Widgets, on the other hand, have mutable state and are used to represent parts of the 
user interface that can change, such as forms or animations.

8.
In Flutter applications, user input can be handled using event handlers, such as onPressed or onSubmitted. These handlers are called
when the user interacts with a widget, such as clicking a button or submitting a form. The data entered by the user can then be passed
to other parts of the application using state management techniques, such as setState or Provider.

9.
Dart is a programming language that is used to write Flutter applications. It is an object-oriented language that is designed to
be easy to learn and use, with features such as optional typing, asynchronous programming, and garbage collection. Dart is used to
write the business logic and user interface of the Flutter application.

10.
Hot Reload is a feature in Flutter that allows developers to make changes to the code and see the changes reflected in the app 
immediately. It speeds up the development cycle by eliminating the need to manually rebuild the app every time a change is made. 
Hot Reload is especially useful during the design and testing phases of development, as it allows developers to quickly experiment 
with different layouts and features.

Section 3: REST API

11.
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a web architecture that specifies how different components of a web application should 
communicate with each other. A REST API is a set of rules and conventions that defines how HTTP requests and responses should be 
structured to perform operations on resources. The key principles of REST architecture are:
Client-server architecture
Statelessness
Cacheability
Layered system
Uniform interface

12.
GET and POST are HTTP methods used in REST API requests. GET is used to retrieve data from a server, while POST is used to submit data
to a server to create or update a resource. GET requests are read-only and should not have any side effects on the server, while POST requests
can have side effects and should not be idempotent.

13.
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations performed on a database. In REST API development, CRUD is used
to perform similar operations on resources. For example, a REST API for managing user data would have endpoints for creating a new user (Create), 
retrieving user data (Read), updating user data (Update), and deleting a user (Delete).

14.
Swagger is an open-source tool used to document REST APIs. It provides a way to describe the structure of API requests and responses using a standard 
format called OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger Specification). Swagger UI is a web application that generates interactive documentation for REST APIs
based on their OpenAPI specifications. Developers can use Swagger to document their APIs and allow other developers to easily understand how to use them.

15.
REST API is a widely adopted web architecture for building scalable and flexible web applications. Some of the benefits of using REST API in modern web 
development are:

Platform independence
Language independence
Scalability and performance
Separation of concerns
Wide adoption and community support

16.
To build a simple Spring Boot REST API to perform CRUD operations on a database table, we need to follow these steps:
First, we need to create a new Spring Boot project using any IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. We can use Spring Initializr
to generate a starter project with the required dependencies.
Next, we need to create an entity class that represents the table we want to perform CRUD operations on. We can use the @Entity annotation to define
the class as an entity and use @Id to define the primary key field.
Then, we need to create a repository interface that extends the JpaRepository interface. This interface will handle all the database operations for us.
After that, we need to create a REST controller that handles the HTTP requests and calls the repository methods to perform CRUD operations on the database.
Finally, we need to configure the database properties in the application.properties file and run the application to test the endpoints.
Here's an example code for a simple Spring Boot REST API to perform CRUD operations on a "User" entity:

@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private String email;

    // getters and setters
}

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @GetMapping
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        return userRepository.findAll();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("User not found with id " + id));
    }

    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User userDetails) {
        User user = userRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("User not found with id " + id));
        user.setName(userDetails.getName());
        user.setEmail(userDetails.getEmail());
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        User user = userRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("User not found with id " + id));
        userRepository.delete(user);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    }
}


17.
Integrating Flutter with Spring Boot REST API:

To integrate the Flutter application with the REST API, you need to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints. Flutter provides the http package for
making HTTP requests. You can use the http package to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the API endpoints.

Here is an example of making a GET request to fetch data from the API endpoint:
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<List<Todo>> fetchTodos() async {
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('http://localhost:8080/todos'));
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    Iterable l = json.decode(response.body);
    List<Todo> todos = List<Todo>.from(l.map((model)=> Todo.fromJson(model)));
    return todos;
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to load todos');
  }
}
In this example, we are making a GET request to fetch todos from the API endpoint http://localhost:8080/todos. We then decode the JSON response 
and convert it into a list of Todo objects.

Similarly, you can use the http package to make POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to perform CRUD operations on the API.

Implementing user authentication and authorization using Spring Security:

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. You can use Spring Security to secure your REST API
endpoints and restrict access to certain resources.

Here is an example of configuring Spring Security to authenticate users using a username and password:
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  
  @Autowired
  private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;
  
  @Override
  protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
    auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService)
      .passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());
  }
  
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
      .antMatchers("/api/public/**").permitAll()
      .anyRequest().authenticated()
      .and()
      .formLogin().loginPage("/login").permitAll()
      .and()
      .logout().logoutSuccessUrl("/login?logout").permitAll();
  }
  
  @Bean
  public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
  }
  
  @Override
  public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
    web.ignoring().antMatchers("/swagger-ui/**", "/v3/api-docs/**");
  }
  
}
In this example, we are configuring Spring Security to use a UserDetailsService to load user details from a database and a BCryptPasswordEncoder to 
encode passwords. We are also configuring the HTTP security to allow public access to the /api/public endpoint and require authentication for all other
endpoints. We are using a form-based login page and a logout URL for authentication and logout.

You can also use Spring Security to implement token-based authentication, role-based access control, and other advanced security features.

Writing unit tests for the REST API endpoints using JUnit and Mockito:

You can use JUnit and Mockito to write unit tests for the REST API endpoints. Unit tests help you ensure that each endpoint is working correctly and 
handling all possible input and output scenarios.

18.
User authentication and authorization is an important aspect of any application that deals with sensitive user data. In this section, we will discuss
how to implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security in a REST API and Flutter application.

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable framework for securing Spring-based applications. It provides a wide range of security features,
including authentication, authorization, and cryptography.

To implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security in a REST API, you can follow these steps:

Add Spring Security dependency to the pom.xml file:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>



@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsService;

    @Autowired
    private JwtRequestFilter jwtRequestFilter;

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService).passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable().authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/api/authenticate").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and().sessionManagement()
            .sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
        http.addFilterBefore(jwtRequestFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
    }
}

@Service
public class UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        Optional<User> user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
        if (!user.isPresent()) {
            throw new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found with username: " + username);
        }
        return new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(user.get().getUsername(), user.get().getPassword(),
                new ArrayList<>());
    }
}


@Component
public class JwtTokenUtil {

    private static final String SECRET_KEY = "secret";

    public String generateToken(UserDetails userDetails) {
        Map<String, Object> claims = new HashMap<>();
        return Jwts.builder().setClaims(claims).setSubject(userDetails.getUsername()).setIssuedAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()))
                .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 10))
                .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS512, SECRET_KEY).compact();
    }

    public boolean validateToken(String token, UserDetails userDetails) {
        String username = extractUsername(token);
        return (username.equals(userDetails.getUsername()) && !isTokenExpired(token));
    }

    private boolean isTokenExpired(String token) {
        return extractExpiration(token).before(new Date());
    }

    private Date extractExpiration(String token) {
        return Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(SECRET_KEY).parseClaimsJws(token).getBody().getExpiration();
    }

    private String extractUsername(String token) {
        return Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(SECRET_KEY).parseClaimsJws(token).getBody().getSubject();
    }
}




@Component
public class JwtRequestFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

    @Autowired
    private JwtTokenUtil jwtTokenUtil;

    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsService
    
    
19.
Sure, here's an example of writing unit tests for a Spring Boot REST API endpoint using JUnit and Mockito.

Assuming we have a UserController class with a GET endpoint to retrieve a user by ID:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    
    private UserService userService;

    @Autowired
    public UserController(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<User> getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        User user = userService.getUserById(id);
        if (user == null) {
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
        return ResponseEntity.ok(user);
    }
}
To test this endpoint, we can create a UserControllerTest class and use Mockito to mock the UserService dependency:

@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
public class UserControllerTest {

    @Mock
    private UserService userService;

    @InjectMocks
    private UserController userController;

    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup(userController).build();
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetUserById() throws Exception {
        // Arrange
        Long userId = 1L;
        User user = new User(userId, "John Doe");

        // Mock the UserService to return the expected user
        Mockito.when(userService.getUserById(userId)).thenReturn(user);

        // Act
        MvcResult mvcResult = mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/users/{id}", userId))
                .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.status().isOk())
                .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.jsonPath("$.id", Matchers.is(userId.intValue())))
                .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.jsonPath("$.name", Matchers.is("John Doe")))
                .andReturn();

        // Assert
        String responseBody = mvcResult.getResponse().getContentAsString();
        User responseUser = new ObjectMapper().readValue(responseBody, User.class);
        Assert.assertEquals(user, responseUser);
    }
}
In this test, we first mock the UserService to return a user with ID 1. Then, we use MockMvc to perform a GET request
to /users/1, and assert that the response status is 200 OK and the response body contains the expected user information

20.
Sure! Here are the steps to document the REST API using Swagger and host it on a cloud platform like Heroku:

Add the Swagger dependencies to your Spring Boot application. You can do this by adding the following lines to your pom.xml file:
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
    <artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
    <version>${swagger.version}</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
    <artifactId>springfox-swagger-ui</artifactId>
    <version>${swagger.version}</version>
</dependency>

Create a Swagger configuration file in your Spring Boot application to configure the Swagger API documentation. You can do this by
creating a new Java class with the following content:
@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {

    @Bean
    public Docket api() {                
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)          
          .select()                                       
          .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())              
          .paths(PathSelectors.any())                          
          .build();
    }
}
Start your Spring Boot application and open the Swagger UI by navigating to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.

Test your API endpoints using the Swagger UI.

Once you have verified that your API documentation is correct, you can deploy your application to a cloud platform like Heroku.

To deploy your application to Heroku, you can follow these steps:

Create a new Heroku account if you don't have one already.
Install the Heroku CLI on your local machine.
Log in to the Heroku CLI using the command heroku login.
Navigate to your Spring Boot application directory.
Create a new Heroku app using the command heroku create.
Push your application code to the Heroku Git remote using the command git push heroku master.
Start the Heroku dyno using the command heroku ps:scale web=1.
Open your application in a web browser by running the command heroku open.
Once your application is deployed to Heroku, you can access the Swagger UI by navigating to https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html.
